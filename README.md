# spicetifycli-marketplace

A fix so that you can install the spicetify-marketplace with spicetify-cli. <br>
I will probably not update this.
<br><br>
# What did i change?
I copied the original [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-marketplace/main/resources/install.sh) and replaced spicetify with spicetify-cli
<br><br>
# install
You can just install the marketplace like normal but then using my modified script <br>
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrSn0wy/spicetify-test/main/install.sh | sh`
